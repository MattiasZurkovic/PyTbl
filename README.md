PyTbl
==========

About
----------
PyTbl (pronounced 'Pi' - 'Table') is a Python library/module that helps you create command-line (console) tables and spreadsheets. It is developed and maintained by Mattias Zurkovic, however if you find a bug or want a change then feel free to contribute! (Please, however, tell me the bug)

Installing
----------
I am currently in the process of putting this library on PyPI and <tt>pip</tt>, but you can still use it - you will just need to install it manually:
* Clone this repository into any destination you would like (<tt>git clone https://github.com/MattiasZurkovic/PyTbl.git</tt>)
* Copy and paste that directory into your Python project's libraries folder. (You need to make sure that it is in the same root as your interpreter)
* Remember, soon you will be able to use <tt>pip</tt> to install the module :-)

TODO
----------
As the library is still in development, I have a 'checklist' for what the library should be able to do:
* Be able to sort the tables values (eg. by length, value, etc.)
* Style the table (colors, label styles)
* Make it more 'automatic'
