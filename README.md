PyTbl
==========

About
----------
PyTbl (pronounced 'Pi' - 'Table') is a Python library/module that helps you create command-line (console) tables and spreadsheets. It is developed and maintained by Mattias Zurkovic, however if you find a bug or want a change then feel free to contribute! (Please, however, tell me the bug)

Installing
----------
I am currently in the process of putting this library on PyPI and <tt>pip</tt>, but you can still use it - you will just need to install it manually:
1. Clone this repository into any destination you would like (<tt>git clone https://github.com/MattiasZurkovic/PyTbl.git</tt>)
2. Copy and paste that directory into your Python project's libraries folder. (You need to make sure that it is in the same root as your interpreter)
* Remember, soon you will be able to use <tt>pip</tt> to install the module :-)
